# randomArt

Personal project used to help learn Python. The program takes in a number of parameters and saves a randomly generated
.png image to the computer.  The program currently supports two types of images: texture, and streak.

Examples of images are included. Steak is currently unimplemented in the current form.

Note: this project was not intended for public release.
